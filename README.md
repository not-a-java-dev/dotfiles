These are my dotfiles, i use them for my new installations so that i can feel right at `$HOME`

You can use them but theyre really bad so i dont really recommend that

This is so that i can install **my** configs. Not yours! you're probably going to run on to some weird aliases and stuff you'll not need/is incompatible, you may use this to make your own configs basing yourself on mines
